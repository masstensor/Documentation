# Phase 2

Phase 2 is an evolved stage of Arkreen Network mainnet supporting bi-directional data/control aggregation for global DERs.

In addition to solar PV panels, Arkreen Network plans to partner with global DER players with various renewable energy facilities such as storage battery and energy saving scheduling. The trusted downlink control channel to the energy facilities will be built to support bi-directional data/control applications. The demand side is enabled to harness the uplink data and coordinate the facilities in the Arkreen Network to schedule the energy more effectively.

In Phase 2, sophisticated applications such as VPP (Virtual Power Plant) are promoted. Both the energy providers and consumers (i.e. prosumers) are getting more proactive by understanding each otherâ€™s capacity or demand better than ever.
