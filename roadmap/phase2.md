# Phase 2

The Phase 2 period **represents an expanded stage for the** Arkreen Network mainnet to support bi-directional data/control aggregation for global DERs.

In addition to solar PV panel vendors, Arkreen Network plans to partner with global DER players with various renewable energy facilities such as storage batteries and energy saving scheduling. A trusted downlink control channel for energy facilities will be built to support bi-directional data/control applications. The demand side is enabled to harness the uplink data and coordinate the facilities in the Arkreen Network to schedule the energy more effectively.

During the Phase 2 period, sophisticated applications such as VPP (Virtual Power Plant) will be promoted. Both energy providers and consumers (i.e. prosumers) will become more proactive by analyzing each otherâ€™s synergistic **** capacity or demand better than ever.
