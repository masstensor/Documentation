# Phase 0

Phase 0 is the earliest phase for the testing purpose.

There are 3 sub-phases:

* Phase 0.1: Gaming Mining Testing Phase
* Phase 0.2: Remote Mining Testing Phase
* Phase 0.3: Standard Mining Testing Phase

## **Phase 0.1**: **Gaming Mining Testing Phase**

Because the physical miner manufacture should take a period, in the early testing phase Gaming Mining is available as the first mining method.

See [What is A Gaming Miner](../arkreen-network/development/miner.md#gaming-miner).

* Token
  * Issues ERC20 gAKRE (gaming AKRE) reward on Polygon network
  * The miner owner earns gAKRE reward in the same way as the mainnet.
  * gAKRE is independent of AKRE
  * gAKRE is non-transferable
  * Registration for a Gaming Miner mints a non-transferable Gaming Miner NFT.
  * If the same owner purchases a remote or standard miner later on during a given period (the Gaming Miner Upgrade Period), the owner will be airdropped with AKRE reward when the mainnet launches in Phase 1. The amount of the airdropped AKRE reward is determined by the gAKRE he/she has earned and when he/she pays for the Remote or Standard Miner (the earlier the more). If an owner has more than one Gaming Miner running at the mainnet launch time, the first applied Gaming Miner is paired with the first purchased Remote or Standard Miner to determine the airdropped AKRE reward amount, the second is paired with the second and so on.
* Lifecycle
  * Gaming Mining starts immediately after the application of a Gaming Miner is confirmed by the owner.
  * Gaming Mining terminates when Phase 0 ends.
  * The ownership of a Gaming Miner is non-transferable.

Note: The term “owner” is represented by a Polygon address which is controlled by an entity.

## **Phase 0.2**: **Remote Mining Testing Phase**

Remote Mining is available from Phase 0.2.

See [What is A Remote Miner](../arkreen-network/development/miner.md#remote-miner).

* Token
  * Issues ERC20 tAKRE (testing AKRE) reward on Polygon network
  * The miner owner earns tAKRE reward in the same way as the mainnet.
  * tAKRE is independent of AKRE
  * tAKRE is non-transferable
  * A non-transferable Remote Miner NFT is minted when a remote miner is pre-ordered or purchased.
* Lifecycle
  * In Phase 0.1, the Remote Miner can be pre-ordered but Remote Mining will not begin until Phase 0.2 starts.
  * From Phase 0.2, Remote Mining is immediately activated after the user purchases the Remote Miner.
  * Remote Miners that start In Phase 0 will automatically move from the testnet to the mainnet when Phase 1 starts.
  * The ownership of a Remote Miner is non-transferable until the Gaming Miner Upgrade Period ends.
  * During the Phase 0 period, the same quantity of Gaming Miners are airdropped to the owner who has pre-ordered or purchased one or more Remote Miners.

## **Phase 0.3**: **Standard Mining Testing Phase**

Standard Mining is available from Phase 0.3.

See [What is A Standard Miner](../arkreen-network/development/miner.md#standard-miner).

* Token
  * Issues ERC20 tAKRE (testing AKRE) reward on Polygon network
  * The miner owner earns tAKRE reward in the same way as the mainnet.
  * tAKRE is independent of AKRE
  * tAKRE is non-transferable
  * A non-transferable Standard Miner NFT is minted when a standard miner is purchased.
* Lifecycle
  * During Phases 0.1\~0.2, a Standard Miner can be pre-ordered but Standard Mining will not begin until the Phase 0.3 period starts.
  * From Phase 0.3 period, a Standard Mining starts immediately as the user onboards the Standard Miner.
  * Standard Miners that start during the Phase 0 period will automatically move from the testnet to the mainnet as the Phase 1 period starts.
  * The ownership of a Standard Miner is non-transferable until the Gaming Miner Upgrade Period ends.
  * During the Phase 0 period, are the same quantity of Gaming Miners airdropped to the owner who has purchased one or more Standard Miners.
