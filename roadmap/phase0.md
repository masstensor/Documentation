# Phase 0

Phase 0 is the earliest phase for the testing purpose.

There are 3 sub-phases:

* Phase 0.1: Gaming Mining Testing Phase
* Phase 0.2: Remote Mining Testing Phase
* Phase 0.3: Standard Mining Testing Phase

## **Phase 0.1**: **Gaming Mining Testing Phase**

Because the physical miner manufacture should take a period, in the early testing phase Gaming Mining is available as the first mining method.

See [What is A Gaming Miner](../arkreen-network/development/miner.md#gaming-miner).

* Token
  * Issue ERC20 gAKRE (gaming AKRE) on Polygon
  * The miner owner earns gAKRE in the same way as the mainnet.
  * gAKRE is independent of AKRE
  * gAKRE is non-transferable
  * Registration for Gaming Miner mints a non-transferable Gaming Miner NFT.
  * If the same owner purchases remote or standard miner later in a given period (the Gaming Miner Upgrade Period), the owner will be airdropped with AKRE when the mainnet launches in Phase 1. The amount of the airdropped AKRE is determined by the gAKRE he/she has earned and when he/she pays for the Remote or Standard Miner (the earlier the more). If an owner has more than one Gaming Miner running at the mainnet launch time, the first applied Gaming Miner is paired with the first purchased Remote or Standard Miner to determine the airdropped AKRE amount, the second is paired with the second and so on.
* Lifecycle
  * Gaming Mining starts immediately when the application of a Gaming Miner is confirmed by the owner.
  * Gaming Mining terminates when Phase 0 ends.
  * The ownership of a Gaming Miner is non-transferable.

Note: The term “owner” is represented by a Polygon address which is controlled by an entity.

## **Phase 0.2**: **Remote Mining Testing Phase**

Remote Mining is available from Phase 0.2.

See [What is A Remote Miner](../arkreen-network/development/miner.md#remote-miner).

* Token
  * Issue ERC20 tAKRE (testing AKRE) on Polygon
  * The miner owner earns tAKRE in the same way as the mainnet.
  * tAKRE is independent of AKRE
  * tAKRE is non-transferable
  * A non-transferable Remote Miner NFT is minted when a remote miner is pre-ordered or purchased.
* Lifecycle
  * In Phase 0.1, Remote Miner can be pre-ordered but Remote Mining will not begin until Phase 0.2 starts.
  * From Phase 0.2, Remote Mining starts immediately when the user purchases the Remote Miner.
  * Remote Miners start In Phase 0 will automatically move from testnet to mainnet when Phase 1 starts.
  * The ownership of a Remote Miner is non-transferable until the Gaming Miner Upgrade Period ends.
  * Only in Phase 0, the same quantity of Gaming Miners are airdropped to the owner who has pre-ordered or purchased one or more Remote Miners.

## **Phase 0.3**: **Standard Mining Testing Phase**

Standard Mining is available from Phase 0.3.

See [What is A Standard Miner](../arkreen-network/development/miner.md#standard-miner).

* Token
  * Issue ERC20 tAKRE (testing AKRE) on Polygon
  * The miner owner earns tAKRE in the same way as the mainnet.
  * tAKRE is independent of AKRE
  * tAKRE is non-transferable
  * A non-transferable Standard Miner NFT is minted when a standard miner is purchased.
* Lifecycle
  * In Phase 0.1\~0.2, Standard Miner can be pre-ordered but Standard Mining will not begin until Phase 0.3 starts.
  * From Phase 0.3, Standard Mining starts immediately when the user onboards the Standard Miner.
  * Standard Miners start In Phase 0 will automatically move from testnet to mainnet when Phase 1 starts.
  * The ownership of a Standard Miner is non-transferable until the Gaming Miner Upgrade Period ends.
  * Only in Phase 0, the same quantity of Gaming Miners are airdropped to the owner who has purchased one or more Standard Miners.
