# Phase 1

The Phase 1 period commences the first stage for Arkreen Network mainnet to support the uplink data aggregation.

The Phase 1 period represents the natural transition from the Phase 0 period. During the Phase 0 period Arkreen Network has connected a lot of solar PV panels to aggregate energy data via Remote Miners and Standard Miners. Unlike Gaming Miners for testing purposes only, the Remote and Standard miners will automatically move to the mainnet as Phase 1 commences. The miner owners can now earn AKRE tokens by contributing the electricity generation data to the Arkreen Network.

In the Phase 1 period, the application scenario starts from solar PV panels (Data Supply Side) and uplink data utilization (Data Demand Side). The data demand side makes use of trusted energy data to provide services such as the issuing of RECs. The REC is represented by a minted NFT and allows Web3 as well as traditional projects, to offset their unavoidable carbon emissions by purchasing and retiring RECs.

arkreen will make open source the Standard Miner hardware specifications for certified and specified equipment manufacturers to launch their own-branded Standard Miners. The Standard Miner must be built on top of the Arkreen-qualified guardian modules to ensure the trust-free data lifecycle.
