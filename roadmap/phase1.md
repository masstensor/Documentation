# Phase 1

Phase 1 is the first stage of Arkreen Network mainnet supporting uplink data aggregation.

Phase 1 is the natural transition from Phase 0. In Phase 0, Arkreen Network has connected a lot of solar PV panels to aggregate energy data via Remote Miners and Standard Miners. Unlike Gaming Miners for testing purpose only, the Remote and Standard miners will automatically move to mainnet when Phase 1 starts. The miner owners can now earn AKRE tokens by contributing the electricity generation data to the Arkreen Network.

In Phase 1, the application scenario starts from solar PV panels (Data Supply Side) and uplink data utilization (Data Demand Side). The data demand side can make use of the trusted energy data to provide services such as REC issuing. The REC is represented by NFT and allows Web3 as well as traditional projects to offset their unavoidable carbon emission by purchasing and retiring the REC.

arkreen will open Standard Miner hardware specification for equipment manufacturers to launch own-branded Standard Miners. The Standard Miner must be built on top of the Arkreen-qualified guardian modules to ensure the trust-free data lifecycle.
