| Phase 0 | Year 1            | <p><strong>Develop Arkreen Network components and test them progressively.</strong><br><br>Arkreen Networks components (the IoT loggers, smart contracts, backend, frontend, App, etc.) are developed and the token issuing and reward model are initially set up. Early network builders are encouraged to participate in the testing of the functionalities and the availability to help the network grow and become stable enough.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Phase 1 | Year 1\~2         | <p><strong>Mainnet starting from solar PV panels, uplink only.</strong><br><br>Arkreen Network aggregates green energy data by incentivizing solar PV panels' owners to plug-in their Arkreen qualified miners to their inverters. The data demand side is encouraged to access the trusted energy data to provide services such as REC issuing and allow Web3 as well as traditional projects to offset their unavoidable carbon emission by purchasing and retiring the REC.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Phase 2 | Year 3\~5         | <p><strong>Bi-directional energy data network for global DERs.</strong><br><br>Arkreen Network will partner with global DER players with various renewable energy facilities such as storage batteries and energy saving scheduling, in addition to solar PV panels and other electricity generation equipment. Not only the energy generation data is collected and uploaded but also the control commands are securely transferred down to the facilities. The demand side is enabled to harness the bi-directional data/control channel to schedule the energy more effectively. Sophisticated applications such as VPP and Green Computation are promoted.</p> |
| Phase 3 | Year 5 and beyond | <p><strong>SubDAO driven climate+crypto solutions.</strong><br><br>Arkreen Network will migrate its experience in the power sector to other fields with climate+crypto solutions. Regenerative Finance (ReFi) <strong></strong> solutions will be explored <strong></strong> to further monetize energy network data.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
