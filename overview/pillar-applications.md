# Pillar Applications

## Generation of Renewable Energy Certificates

Based on the Arkreen Network’s green power, we combine blockchain, IoT, AI and other convergent technologies to formulate a technically credible and verifiable Renewable Energy Certificate (REC), then provision it to buyers who need to offset their carbon emissions. An Arkreen-based REC will be generated via the renewable energy data collected. For more information, kindly, refer to the existing [RE100](https://www.there100.org/) standard.

## Virtual Power Plant (VPP)

Arkreen plans to further promote distributed energy resources to achieve a higher proportion of clean energy in the grid, thereby further promoting virtual power plant applications built on the Arkreen Network to enable prosumers to monetize their flexibility and demand response potential with real-time green energy data.

We also plan to cooperate with potential VPP grid operators to jointly promote the structural transformation of the grid to accelerate the grid’s decarbonization.
