## **Gaming Miner**

A Gaming Miner is a testnet only remote application that simulates a physical miner. Everyone can apply for up to one Gaming Miner for free. It's also airdropped to the network builders who have pre-ordered remote or standard miners. A Gaming Miner simulates a physical miner except that it's not eligible for any physical application (e.g. REC issuing). A Gaming Miner mines gAKRE (gaming AKRE). A Gaming Miner NFT is minted for every Gaming Miner.

## **Remote Miner**

A Remote Miner is a fractional miner running remotely. A guardian module which is plugged on the energy facility (e.g. inverters in a solar farm), on behalf of the collective miner owners, fractionizes the energy facility capacity to multiple ones of 0.1kW each and participants in Arkreen Network. A Remote Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) in Phase 0 and then AKRE when the mainnet is launched in Phase 1. A Remote Miner NFT is minted for every Remote Miner when it's purchased.

## **Standard Miner**&#x20;

A Standard Miner is a plug-in dongle that the solar PV owners could plug into their existing inverters to upgrade the facilities and participate in Arkreen Network. A Standard Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) in Phase 0 and then AKRE when the mainnet is launched in Phase 1. A Standard Miner NFT is minted for every Standard Miner when it's purchased.

The 1st generation Standard Miner is DTU form-factor as a retrofit solution to upgrade existing photovoltaic panel equipment.

The Standard Miner which is plugged into the inverter, is an indispensable component of the PV system. The cellular connectivity is already built in. All you need to do is plugging the miner and binding it with the Arkreen Mobile App before you could earn rewards.

This Starndard Miner kit comes with:

* Arkreen Standard Miner
* Extension Cable for Dedicated Inverter
* Pre-installed SIM card with 1 or 3 years of free cellular connectivity
