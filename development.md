# Development

## Technical Roadmap

Arkreen Network will progressively decentralize and build out its platform as the project progresses through phase 1.

* **Phase 1.0: Gaming Mining - Testnet**
  * Token
    * ERC20 gAKRE (game AKRE) on Polygon
    * gAKRE is independent of AKRE and can be mapped to mainnet AKRE per certain rules if the same owner purchases physical Arkreen Miner later in a given period.
    * The miner earns gAKRE in the same way as the mainnet.
    * gAKRE is non-transferable
  * Supported network rewards
    * Proof of Green-Energy Generation (PoGG, see Proof of Green-Energy Generation for detail).
  * Supported mining methods
    * Game Mining: For those who actively contribute to the network, they can apply for Gaming Miners free of charge. A Gaming Miner is a custodian application that simulates what a physical Arkreen Miner does, to test the network usability.
* **Phase 1.1: Remote Mining - Testnet**
  * Token
    * ERC20 tAKRE (testing AKRE) on Polygon
    * tAKRE is independent of AKRE and can be mapped to AKRE later.
    * The Remote Miner earns tAKRE in the same way as the mainnet.
    * tAKRE is non-transferable
  * Supported network rewards
    * Proof of Green-Energy Generation (PoGG)
  * Supported mining methods
    * Those who pre-order a Remote Miner would be airdropped with a Gaming Miner.
    * Gaming Mining terminates when the Remote Miner is onboarded.
    * Remote Mining: For those who don’t have photovoltaic power equipment, they can register for participating with Remote Mining. A Remote Miner is a custodian photovoltaic power equipment with an Arkreen Guardian Module plugged in the selected solar farm. Participated builders could purchase the Remote Miner with minimal 0.1kW capacity. Remote Miner collects green energy data directly from the equipment via Guardian Module.
  * Aggregate and tokenize green energy data to mint carbon data NFT for the issuing of REC. MOU with Web3 projects for the REC purchase.
  * Simulated data from Game Mining are tagged with “gaming” and could not issue REC.
* **Phase 1.2: Standard Mining - Testnet**
  * Token
    * Same as Phase 1.1
  * Supported network rewards
    * Proof of Green-Energy Generation (PoGG)
    * Mining staking and delegated mining staking to be started
  * Supported mining methods
    * Those who pre-order a Standard Miner would be airdropped with a Gaming Miner.
    * Gaming Mining
    * Remote Mining
    * Standard Mining: For those who have already purchased Arkreen-qualified IoT-direct DTU Miner, they can plug the logger into their photovoltaic equipment. In this phase, the Standard Miner collects the energy data and directly reports to the Arkreen Network.
  * Provide REC for WEB 3.0 projects to offset their carbon emission
* **Phase 1.3: Mainnet**
  * Token
    * Mainnet ERC20 AKRE on Polygon
    * gAKRE and tAKRE are mapped per certain rules
  * Supported network rewards
    * Proof of Green-Energy Generation (PoGG)
  * Supported mining methods
    * Remote Mining
    * Standard Mining
  * Open Arkreen Miner hardware standard for equipment manufacturers to launch own-branded Standard Miners. The Standard Miner must be built on top of the Arkreen Guardian Modules.
  * Rapid growth in Arkreen’s renewable energy assets & asset derivatives plus a docking process with DeFi applications, creating a market effect.

## Miner

### Arkreen Miner

1st generation Arkreen Miner is DTU form-factor as a retrofit solution to upgrade existing photovoltaic panel equipment to easily and quickly access the Arkreen network for incentive rewards.

| Gaming Miner   | A Gaming Miner is a testnet only remote application that simulates a physical miner. Network builders can apply for Gaming Miners for free. It's also airdropped to the network builder who has pre-ordered a remote or standard miner. A Gaming Miner simulates a physical miner except that it's not eligible for REC issue. A Gaming Miner mines gAKRE (gaming AKRE) until the owner's remote or standard miner is onboarded. A Gaming Miner NFT is minted for every airdropped Gaming Miner. | gAKRE (testnet)                          | Phase 1.0      | ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)     |
| Remote Miner   | A Remote Miner is a fractional miner running remotely. A guardian module which is plugged on the energy facility (e.g. inverters in a solar farm), on behalf of the collecive miner owners, fractionizes the energy facility capacity to multiple ones of 0.1kW each and participats in Arkreen Network. A Remote Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) in the testnet and then AKRE when the mainnet is launched. A Remote Miner NFT is minted for every Remote Miner when it's onboarded.           | <p>tAKRE (testnet)<br>AKRE (mainnet)</p> | Phase 1.1      | ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)     |
| Standard Miner | A Standard Miner is a plug-in dongle that the solar PV owners could plug into their existing inverters to upgrade the facilities and participate in Arkreen Network. A Standard Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) in the testnet and then AKRE when the mainnet is launched. A Standard Miner NFT is minted for every Standard Miner when it's onboarded.                                                                                                                                         | <p>tAKRE (testnet)<br>AKRE (mainnet)</p> | Phase 1.2\~1.3 | ![](<.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>) |
