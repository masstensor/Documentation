## **Gaming Miner**

A Gaming Miner is a testnet only remote application that simulates a physical miner. Everyone can apply for up to one Gaming Miner for free. It's also airdropped to the network builders who have pre-ordered either a remote or standard miner. A Gaming Miner simulates a physical miner, except that it's not eligible for any physical applications (e.g., REC issuing). A Gaming Miner mines gAKRE (gaming AKRE). A Gaming Miner NFT is minted per each Gaming Miner.

## **Remote Miner**

A Remote Miner is a fractional miner running remotely. An IoT data collector which is plugged on the energy facility (e.g. inverters in a solar farm), on behalf of the collective miner owners, fractionizes the energy facility capacity to multiple ones of 0.1kW each and participants in Arkreen Network. A Remote Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) in Phase 0 and then AKRE when the mainnet is launched in Phase 1. A Remote Miner NFT is minted per each Remote Miner, upon purchase.

## **Standard Miner**&#x20;

A Standard Miner is a plug\&play smart data logger device that solar PV owners plug into their existing inverters to upgrade the facilities and participate in Arkreen Network. A Standard Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) tokens in Phase 0 and then AKRE tokens when the mainnet is launched in Phase 1. A Standard Miner NFT is minted per each Standard Miner during manufacture, and transferred to the owner upon miner on-boarding.

The 1st generation Standard Miner is smart data logger device, a retrofitted solution to upgrade existing photovoltaic panel equipment.

The Standard Miner, which is plugged into the inverter, is an indispensable component of the PV system. The cellular connectivity is already built in. All you need to do is to plug the miner and bind it with the Arkreen Mobile App before you can earn rewards.

This Standard Miner kit comes with:

* Arkreen Standard Miner
* Extension Cable for Dedicated Inverter
* Pre-loaded SIM card with 1 or 3 years of free cellular connectivity
