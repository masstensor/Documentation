# The Pain Points to resolve

Carbon neutrality is one of the biggest challenges facing mankind in the 21st century. Among the most significant contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) is the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the power solutions, accounting for around 30% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions ([EPA: Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions)).

As the global economic growth has demanded more and more electricity, the carbon neutralization progress of the power system plays a key role. That’s why IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)’s investigation has called for serious concern on renewable energy to mitigate the climate impact.

Hydropower, wind power, solar power, and biomass power are primary renewable energy resources for electricity generation. Today hydropower contributes to the majority of the green electricity. However, it’s nowhere near enough. Other types of renewable energy such as photovoltaic power are quite scattered. The longtail small-scale DERs (Distributed Energy Resources) are often underutilized due to the difficulty to collect, exchange and harness the energy data for better usage.

The purpose of Arkreen Network is to build a decentralized bi-directional data infrastructure to reduce the friction in energy data harnessing and thus foster various applications around DER.
