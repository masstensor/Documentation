# Arkreen Network Vision

We believe an infrastructure that could aggregate data from and pass downlink control to energy facilities in a secure and trusted way, is the foundation for a thriving distributed renewable energy ecosystem. The purpose of the Arkreen Network is building such an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) on the shoulder of Web3's power.There are various pieces of equipment and scenarios that generate, store or consume renewable electricity. Thus it’s a complex technical, engineering and economical problem how to coordinate and incentivize all participants to achieve higher efficiency and lower carbon emission. The de-carbonization effort is contributed to if:

* A generation party generates more renewable electricity to decrease the overall requirement for fossil-based electricity
* A storage party absorbs energy in times of abundant generation and feed to the consumer or the grid in times of shortage, which reduces the wasted energy amount and thus increases the usage efficiency
* A consumption party reduces its total consumption
* A consumption party moves parts of its power plan from energy shortage time to abundant time

To help resolve the problem, Arkreen Network builds the trusted data/control IaaS on 3 pillars: the IoT, the blockchain and the token economy.

* The IoT ensures that the energy measurement data can be collected directly from the equipment without any middleman, as well as any remote control instructions could be securely passed to the equipment to meet the coordination requirements.
* The blockchain, which is a decentralized tamper-resistant ledger, protects data integrity and transparency among any participants who don’t have to trust each other.
* The token economy incentivizes the participants to contribute to the infrastructure and benefit from the network as a result of the green asset circulation and service income.

Upon the Arkreen IaaS, the participants may conduct various energy services such as VPP (Virtual Power Plant) and accurate monitoring and forecasting, as well as financial services such as REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) trading and Real-World-Asset collateralization. Such applications are believed to foster the renewable energy ecosystem.
