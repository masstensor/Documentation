# Global Electric Vehicle Charging Network

After Arkreen Network features has been finalized, we will then provide various charging use case for builders and motivate them to offer charging columns to provide electric vehicle charging services for the world. Hence, we will emulate an E-mobility model fashioned after Energy Web to accomplish the sharing of this infrastructure.

Electric car owners can perform an online search for available charging column stations located nearby through Arkreen or Arkreen's partnerâ€™s charging APP. After the vehicle charging process is completed, the vehicle owner will pay a fee for charging their vehicle, and Then Arkreen Foundation will provide the equivalent of 80% AKRE to builders, 10% will be retained in the foundation, and 10% will be burned.
