# DER (Distributed Energy Resources) Operations Platform

For the communities with enough energy network nodes, we plan to further promote a Distributed Energy Resources network solution to achieve the proportion of clean energy in the grid, thereby further promoting the centralized clean energy carried by the main grid.

We also plan to cooperate with potential Distributed Energy Resources (DER) grid operators to jointly promote the structural transformation of the grid to accelerate the gridâ€™s decarbonization.
