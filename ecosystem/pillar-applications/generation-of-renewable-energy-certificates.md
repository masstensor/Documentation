# Generation of Renewable Energy Certificates

The world has already established a renewable energy certificate trading mechanism to support carbon neutrality, while undertaking a full-cycle theme of "Carbon neutrality demand - Carbon asset creation - Carbon financial support". However, the core problems for renewable energy certificate markets remain the lack of liquidity, substandard assets, expandability issues, and questionable credibility. Therefore, sufficient and credible carbon assets (for construction and investment), and renewable energy certificates (for trading, neutralization) are being provided as initiatives to solve such important issues.

Based on the Arkreen Networkâ€™s green power, we combine blockchain, IoT, AI and other convergent technologies to formulate a technically credible and verifiable Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) program, then provision it to buyers who need carbon neutrality. This move will provide asset liquidity for a green certificate market, thereby promoting green carbon neutrality. Combining these resources, we are eager to cooperate with potential partners to create solutions and set global standards. Please refer to the existing RE100 standard.
