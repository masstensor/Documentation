# Global green power computing network

In order to propel the digital industry into overdrive mode for carbon neutrality, Arkreen plans to build a green power network all over the world, and provide centralized and distributed clean power resources for Internet data centers (IDCâ€™s, especially in a WEB 3 world), and realize the integration of green power with computing power.

For distributed (decentralized) green power sources, the Arkreen network will sell clean energy power generation equipment (such as photovoltaic power generation equipment) with built-in computing modules to incentivize builders. Hence, enthusiastic builders can install the mining equipment on a balcony or on the roof of their homes or commercials, and the generated electricity will be used for network distributed computing tasks. At the same time, the electricity can also be used by builders for their own use (such as mobile phone charging).

For centralized green power sources, the Arkreen Network will provide builders with centralized green power resources (such as photovoltaics, wind power plants), and builders can choose any number of green power resource units (such as photovoltaic panels) of any project to obtain tokenized renewable energy assets to receive Arkreen's Network incentives and future electricity sales revenue.

The demand for green computing power will require the purchase of green computing services from the foundation. The foundation will provide the AKRE equivalent to 80% of the fiat currency paid by the demander to the builders who provide computing services. Additionally, 10% will be returned to the foundation for the operations, and a further 10% will be burned (dropped) to achieve deflation.
