# Voting

In early stage, voting will be for (1) selecting accredited governance committee members to participate in network governance; (2) voting on matters that AIP cannot work. After the network is matured(expected 3-5 years), we will transition to a pure on-chain voting model in stages. The specific vote will be for (1)(2) as mentioned above, and (3) to initiate, support or modify a proposal under the premise that the approval rate reaches 1%.

The voting rules will be enacted in Compound style.
