| Gaming Miner   | A Gaming Miner is a testnet only remote application that simulates a physical miner. Network builders can apply for Gaming Miners for free. It's also airdropped to the network builder who has pre-ordered a remote or standard miner. A Gaming Miner simulates a physical miner except that it's not eligible for REC issue. A Gaming Miner mines gAKRE (gaming AKRE) until the owner's remote or standard miner is onboarded. A Gaming Miner NFT is minted for every airdropped Gaming Miner. | gAKRE (testnet)                          | Phase 1.0      | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)     |
| Remote Miner   | A Remote Miner is a fractional miner running remotely. A guardian module which is plugged on the energy facility (e.g. inverters in a solar farm), on behalf of the collecive miner owners, fractionizes the energy facility capacity to multiple ones of 0.1kW each and participats in Arkreen Network. A Remote Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) in the testnet and then AKRE when the mainnet is launched. A Remote Miner NFT is minted for every Remote Miner when it's onboarded.           | <p>tAKRE (testnet)<br>AKRE (mainnet)</p> | Phase 1.1      | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png>)     |
| Standard Miner | A Standard Miner is a plug-in dongle that the solar PV owners could plug into their existing inverters to upgrade the facilities and participate in Arkreen Network. A Standard Miner mines tAKRE (testing AKRE) in the testnet and then AKRE when the mainnet is launched. A Standard Miner NFT is minted for every Standard Miner when it's onboarded.                                                                                                                                         | <p>tAKRE (testnet)<br>AKRE (mainnet)</p> | Phase 1.2\~1.3 | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>) |
