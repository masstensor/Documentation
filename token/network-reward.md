# Network Reward

While there's no exact formula for calculating how much AKRE you'll earn over a given period, there are some high level concepts, design elements, and rules to keep in mind that will help better explain what you might earn and why. This section covers these, as well as some mining and token reward basics.

## How Do Builders Earn Arkreen Tokens?

The Arkreen Network rewards builders for providing Green Energy Generation data. Builders are rewarded in Arkreen Token rewards, with a total of 3 billion AKRE. AKRE is rewarded every epoch (each approximately 60 minutes) to a lot of miners who correctly provide green power data and are randomly selected according to an algorithm. The PoGG algorithm will be discussed in the “[Proof of Green-Energy Generation](../technical-details/proof-of-green-energy-generation.md)” section.

## Reward Issuance Schedule

The Arkreen Network will reward all participants who have contributed to the network construction according to a decreasing plan, which lasts for a total of 40 years. The number of AKRE awarded each year is shown in the following table:

| Year   | Reward per Year | Year   | Reward per Year |
| ------ | --------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| 1\~2   | 200 million     | 3\~4   | 180 million     |
| 5\~6   | 160 million     | 7\~8   | 140 million     |
| 9\~10  | 120 million     | 11\~12 | 110 million     |
| 13\~14 | 100 million     | 15\~16 | 90 million      |
| 17\~18 | 80 million      | 19\~20 | 70 million      |
| 21\~22 | 60 million      | 23\~24 | 50 million      |
| 25\~26 | 40 million      | 27\~28 | 30 million      |
| 29\~30 | 20 million      | 31\~32 | 20 million      |
| 33\~34 | 10 million      | 35\~36 | 10 million      |
| 37\~38 | 5 million       | 39\~40 | 5 million       |

## Target AKRE Production Per Epoch

An epoch is roughly 60 minutes. The epochs for different durations are listed in the table below:

| Duration | Epoches |
| -------- | ------- |
| Day      | 24      |
| Week     | 168     |
| Month    | 720     |
| Year     | 8,760   |

Assuming that the Arkreen network launches on January 1, 2023 and the number of AKRE rewards in the first year will be 200 million, the number of reward cycles corresponding to different time units are calculated below as:

| Period | Rewarded AKREs |
| ------ | -------------- |
| Epoch  | 22,831         |
| Day    | 547,945        |
| Week   | 3,835,616      |
| Month  | 16,438,356     |
