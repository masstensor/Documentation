# Overview

## Background and the Pain Points

Carbon neutrality is one of the biggest challenges facing mankind in the 21st century. Among the most significant contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) is the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emitted by the power solutions, accounting for around 30% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.

As the global economic growth has demanded more and more electricity, the carbon neutralization progress of the power system plays a key role. That’s why IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)’s investigation has called for serious concern on renewable energy to mitigate the climate impact.

Hydropower, wind power, solar power, and biomass power are primary renewable energy resources for electricity generation. Today hydropower contributes to the majority of the green electricity. However, it’s nowhere near enough. One of the obstacles that may impede faster growth of renewable electricity is the fragmentation of the facilities. Unlike hydropower, which is centralized and can only be built by wealthy private parties or governments, other types of renewable energy such as photovoltaic power are quite scattered. The longtail small-scale DERs (Distributed Energy Resources) are often excluded from the grid due to the rigid requirements and restrictions (e.g. the minimum capacity) for the power grid interconnection. These underutilized energy resources are the pain points that may be exploited to foster DER growth.

IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence), blockchain (Distributed Ledger Technology) and token economy are the key points to work out. By digitizing the energy facility’s parameter and status, a twined context reflecting the physical facility could be created in the digital world. Blockchain protects the data integrity and in addition token economy encourages participants (energy producers, consumers or both, to be prosumers) to build a harmonious DER ecosystem and monetize their contribution with little friction. With those innovative technologies, Arkreen Network aims to build up this infrastructure in a decentralized way from bottom-up by incentivized renewable energy prosumers.

## **The Arkreen Network**

To boost the longtail distributed renewable energy ecosystem, Arkreen Network is developed to build a Web3-powered infrastructure for globally-distributed renewable resources connection and monetization to enable carbon-reduction applications.

We believe an infrastructure that could aggregate data from and pass downlink control to energy facilities in a secure and trusted way, is the foundation for a thriving distributed renewable energy ecosystem. The purpose of the Arkreen Network is building such an IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) on the shoulder of Web3's power.

There are various pieces of equipment and scenarios that generate, store or consume renewable electricity. Thus it’s a complex technical, engineering and economical problem how to coordinate and incentivize all participants to achieve higher efficiency and lower carbon emission. The de-carbonization effort is contributed to if: A generation party generates more renewable electricity to decrease the overall requirement for fossil-based electricity A storage party absorbs energy in times of abundant generation and feed to the consumer or the grid in times of shortage, which reduces the wasted energy amount and thus increases the usage efficiency A consumption party reduces its total consumption A consumption party moves parts of its power plan from energy shortage time to abundant time

To help resolve the problem, Arkreen Network builds the trusted data/control IaaS on 3 pillars: the IoT, the blockchain and the token economy.

The IoT ensures that the energy measurement data can be collected directly from the equipment without any middleman, as well as any remote control instructions could be securely passed to the equipment to meet the coordination requirements. The blockchain, which is a decentralized tamper-resistant ledger, protects data integrity and transparency among any participants who don’t have to trust each other. The token economy incentivizes the participants to contribute to the infrastructure and benefit from the network as a result of the green asset circulation and service income.

Upon the Arkreen IaaS, the participants may conduct various energy services such as VPP (Virtual Power Plant) and accurate monitoring and forecasting, as well as financial services such as REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) trading and Real-World-Asset collateralization. Such applications are believed to foster the renewable energy ecosystem.
