# What is Arkreen Network

Arkreen is the combination of **Ark** and (g)**reen**, meaning an ark aggregating and carrying green energy data to the future.

Arkreen Network is a web3-powered digital infrastructure for globally-distributed renewable energy resources connection and monetization to boost carbon-reduction applications.

The **Supply Side** uses Arkreen Network to declare how much renewable electricity it generates. The network rewards the participating suppliers for their contribution.

The **Demand Side** uses Arkreen Network to access the electricity data and build applications and services (e.g. REC or Renewable Energy Certificate issuing and VPP or Virtual Power Plant) based on it.

Arkreen Network is built on IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence), blockchain (Distributed Ledger Technology) and token economy. By digitizing the energy facilityâ€™s parameter and status, a twined context reflecting the physical facility could be created in the digital world. Blockchain protects the data integrity and in addition token economy encourages participants (energy producers, consumers or both, to be prosumers) to build a harmonious DER (Distributed Energy Resources) ecosystem and monetize their contribution with little friction. With those innovative technologies, Arkreen Network aims to build up this infrastructure in a decentralized way from bottom-up by incentivized renewable energy prosumers.
