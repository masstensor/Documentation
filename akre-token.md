# AKRE Token

## Network Primitives

### Epochs

Arkreen Network approximately every 60 minutes marks the passing of an epoch. Mining rewards are distributed per epoch (as opposed to per block in most blockchain-based systems). At the conclusion of each epoch, the Arkreen Foundation will distribute all the AKRE produced in that epoch via the rewards transaction.

### Transactions

The Arkreen Network has many transaction types. Following are the most important ones: Registration transaction: adding a Solar Miner to the Arkreen network; Rewards transaction: trigger the Arkreen network to reward each participant.

### Accounts, Wallets and Keys

The Arkreen Network uses an EVM compatible ERC20 smart contract to manage participant’s token balance. Users can use the Arkreen mobile application wallet and manage their balance.&#x20;
