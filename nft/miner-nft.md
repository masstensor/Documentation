# Miner NFT

Miners are the nodes and core blocks of Arkreen Decentralized Renewable Energy Network. Miners generate renewable energy (RE) and present the RE generation proof, which makes the REC (Renewable Energy Certificate) issuance accountable and verifiable.

It is respectable and honorable as an owner of Arkreen miners to contribute to reducing carbon emissions and protecting the global living environment. To thank miners for their contribution, NFTs are minted to all Arkreen miner owners as an honor.&#x20;

## Gaming Miner NFT

Gaming Miner is the boot utility of the Arkreen network, which simulates the mining process, verifies the mining system, attracts green earth builders, and strengthens the Arkreen community.

Gaming Miner NFT is the identification of the gaming miner on the Polygon blockchain, and can only be minted within the Arkreen Phase 0.&#x20;

In project Phase 0, anyone who books and/or orders remote miners and/or standard miners will receive a gaming miner NFT per miner. The gaming miner identified by the NFT will be running until the launch of Arkreen mainnet, and the mining yield gAKRE is convertible to ARKE by governance rules.&#x20;

Gaming miner NFT is open and free to be minted by all volunteers who want to try the renewable energy mining process. As rewards, gAKRE tokens are yielded, but these gAKRE tokens can only be converted to AKRE if the owner has booked/ordered remote/standard miners. The earlier the order, the higher the conversion ratio.&#x20;

Gaming Miner NFT is non-transferrable, and stays in the owner’s account lastingly even if the gaming mining period is finished.&#x20;

## Remote Miner NFT

Once a remote miner is ordered, the remote miner onboarding starts right away, at the same time a respective remote miner NFT is minted to the owner. In project Phase 0, remote mining yields tAKRE, which can be converted to AKRE under governance rules. Starting from Phase 1, remote miner yields ARKE same as other types of miners.&#x20;

If the remote miners are booked in the project’s early phase, these remote miners will be boarded in batches by Arkreen teams once they are available for delivery, and in parallel, remote miner NFTs will be minted for their owners.&#x20;

## Standard Miner NFT

Similarly, an NFT is minted for each standard miner. The onboarding process needs to be accomplished by the owner to make a standard miner start mining. Standard miner NFT is minted within the onboarding process. The same, in project Phase 0, tAKRE tokens are mined, and ARKE tokens are mined starting from Phase 1.&#x20;

Various miner NFTs represent the ownership of the respective miner, it is not meant any monetary value. But with the progress of the Arkreen project, it is not ruled out that we could endow some privileges to the owners of the miner NFTs in the activities such as stake farming, governance voting, community involvement, and so on.
