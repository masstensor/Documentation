# Background and the Pain Points

Carbon neutrality is one of the biggest challenges facing mankind in the 21st century. Among the most significant contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) is the carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by the power solutions, accounting for around 30% of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.

As the global economic growth has demanded more and more electricity, the carbon neutralization progress of the power system plays a key role. That’s why IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)’s investigation has called for serious concern on renewable energy to mitigate the climate impact.

Hydropower, wind power, solar power, and biomass power are primary renewable energy resources for electricity generation. Today hydropower contributes to the majority of the green electricity. However, it’s nowhere near enough. One of the obstacles that may impede faster growth of renewable electricity is the fragmentation of the facilities. Unlike hydropower, which is centralized and can only be built by wealthy private parties or governments, other types of renewable energy such as photovoltaic power are quite scattered. The longtail small-scale DERs (Distributed Energy Resources) are often excluded from the grid due to the rigid requirements and restrictions (e.g. the minimum capacity) for the power grid interconnection. These underutilized energy resources are the pain points that may be exploited to foster DER growth.

IoT (Internet of Things), AI (Artificial Intelligence), blockchain (Distributed Ledger Technology) and token economy are the key points to work out. By digitizing the energy facility’s parameter and status, a twined context reflecting the physical facility could be created in the digital world. Blockchain protects the data integrity and in addition token economy encourages participants (energy producers, consumers or both, to be prosumers) to build a harmonious DER ecosystem and monetize their contribution with little friction. With those innovative technologies, Arkreen Network aims to build up this infrastructure in a decentralized way from bottom-up by incentivized renewable energy prosumers.
