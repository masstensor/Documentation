# Pillar Applications

We will center on the following few paths to build the network.

## Generation of Renewable Energy Certificates
The world has already established a renewable energy certificate trading mechanism to support carbon neutrality, while undertaking a full-cycle theme of "Carbon neutrality demand - Carbon asset creation - Carbon financial support". However, the core problems for renewable energy certificate markets remain the lack of liquidity, substandard assets, expandability issues, and questionable credibility. Therefore, sufficient and credible carbon assets (for construction and investment), and renewable energy certificates (for trading, neutralization) are being provided as initiatives to solve such important issues.

Based on the Arkreen Network’s green power, we combine blockchain, IoT, AI and other convergent technologies to formulate a technically credible and verifiable Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) program, then provision it to buyers who need carbon neutrality. This move will provide asset liquidity for a green certificate market, thereby promoting green carbon neutrality. Combining these resources, we are eager to cooperate with potential partners to create solutions and set global standards. Please refer to the existing RE100 standard.

## Global green power computing network
In order to propel the digital industry into overdrive mode for carbon neutrality, Arkreen plans to build a green power network all over the world, and provide centralized and distributed clean power resources for Internet data centers (IDC’s, especially in a WEB 3 world), and realize the integration of green power with computing power.

For distributed (decentralized) green power sources, the Arkreen network will sell clean energy power generation equipment (such as photovoltaic power generation equipment) with built-in computing modules to incentivize builders. Hence, enthusiastic builders can install the mining equipment on a balcony or on the roof of their homes or commercials, and the generated electricity will be used for network distributed computing tasks. At the same time, the electricity can also be used by builders for their own use (such as mobile phone charging).

For centralized green power sources, the Arkreen Network will provide builders with centralized green power resources (such as photovoltaics, wind power plants), and builders can choose any number of green power resource units (such as photovoltaic panels) of any project to obtain tokenized renewable energy assets to receive Arkreen's Network incentives and future electricity sales revenue.

The demand for green computing power will require the purchase of green computing services from the foundation. The foundation will provide the AKRE equivalent to 80% of the fiat currency paid by the demander to the builders who provide computing services. Additionally, 10% will be returned to the foundation for the operations, and a further 10% will be burned (dropped) to achieve deflation.

## Global Electric Vehicle Charging Network
After Arkreen Network features has been finalized, we will then provide various charging use case for builders and motivate them to offer charging columns to provide electric vehicle charging services for the world. Hence, we will emulate an E-mobility model fashioned after Energy Web to accomplish the sharing of this infrastructure.

Electric car owners can perform an online search for available charging column stations located nearby through Arkreen or Arkreen's partner’s charging APP. After the vehicle charging process is completed, the vehicle owner will pay a fee for charging their vehicle, and Then Arkreen Foundation will provide the equivalent of 80% AKRE to builders, 10% will be retained in the foundation, and 10% will be burned.

## Residential and Commercial Energy Management System
We will deliver energy solutions to provide Arkreen Network participants with more diverse residential and commercial energy solution options to save on energy bills.

For those builders who are participating in an energy management scheme, we will issue NFT identities and increase their reward standard. In this area, we will be eager to cooperate with existing solution providers, as well as with community members to be potential partners.

## DER (Distributed Energy Resources) Operations Platform For the communities with enough energy network nodes, we plan to further promote a Distributed Energy Resources network solution to achieve the proportion of clean energy in the grid, thereby further promoting the centralized clean energy carried by the main grid.

We also plan to cooperate with potential Distributed Energy Resources (DER) grid operators to jointly promote the structural transformation of the grid to accelerate the grid’s decarbonization.
